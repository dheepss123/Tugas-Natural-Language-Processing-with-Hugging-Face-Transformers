If he reads that or something that he notices he will see the real message.

If someone had the same problem using this library, the results would be a great way to teach you about other ways in which to write an understandable, readable code.\\n\\nAlso, because it's so easy, it's very easy to maintain, and I got a lot less spam on it than I thought I would.\\n\\nNow to the next part.
